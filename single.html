District Registrars are employees of local councils (local government) but are supervised by staff of the MoHS. Almost all of the 149 Chiefdoms have a Community Health Officer (an employee of MoHS) who registers births and deaths. A careful assessment of the vital statistics system has not been carried out, to determine the extent of completeness of registration of births and deaths in the country.There is a national office for Civil Registration of all Sierra Leoneans and other nationals living in Sierra Leone.
